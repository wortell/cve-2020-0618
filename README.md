# CVE-2020-0618 Honeypot
- Detects and logs attempts to exploit CVE-020-0618 (SQL Reporting Services RCE)
- Serves content and headers like SSRS would, in order to increase chance of indexing on search engines (e.g. google, shodan etc.)
- Based on the great work of [MDSec](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/02/cve-2020-0618-rce-in-sql-server-reporting-services-ssrs/)

## Installation

### Get the code
Make sure you have a [Go](https://golang.org/) environment ready to go.

```
git clone github.com/wortell/cve-2020-0618
```

### Generate certificates
Generate self signed certificate:
```
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -out server.key
openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650
```

### Run
It's easy as:
```
./honeypot
```

The honeypot will listen on both port `80` and `443` (so it must be run as `root` user)

Or to detach and run as a background process:
```
nohup ./honeypot &
```

## Logs
Results / data is written to the `./log` directory. They are:

`cve.log` - Exploitation attempts and exploitation attempts with all data (e.g. headers, post body)

`allrequests.log` - All HTTP requests that are observed hitting the server

`tls.log` - Often internet scanners will send invalid data to port `443`. HTTPS errors are logged here.
